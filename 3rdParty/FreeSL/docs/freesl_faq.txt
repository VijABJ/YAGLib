FreeSL FAQ (last updated: 2006-09-06)
=====================================

Q: Why is no sound playing?
A: The most common reason for this is that you are using another version of OpenAL
   than version 1.1. OpenAL DLL are included together with FreeSL, use those DLL files.

Q: I try to stream a sound but it doesnt play for more than one second?
A: You are not calling "fslUpdate" as often as you should. How often you should call
   "fslUpdate" depends on the file and what rate it is on. You can also call
   "fslSetAutoUpdate(true)" so that you do not have to call "fslUpdate" yourself.

Q: I have a question about FreeSL, who should I ask?
A: You can e-mail me (axodoss@hotmail.com) the question. I always try to answer
   as fast as I can.

Q: Why is there no MP3 support in FreeSL?
A: MP3 is not free (http://www.mp3licensing.com/). If you have the money for the license
   then perhaps you would be more interested in a library like Fmod (http://www.fmod.org/)
   or the Miles Sound System (http://www.radgametools.com/miles.htm).
