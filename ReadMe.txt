Yet Another Game Library is a wrapper around directdraw and directgraphics
so that either can be used interchangeably when creating games.  It also
includes other non-graphics components like threading support, keyboard and
mouse handling, a basic windowing system, sprite/texture management objects,
and a framework to wrap all of the above for easy and convenient use. A sample 
program, or two, would also probably be included. 

The framework provides a wrapper to the opensource FreeSL by Lukas Heise 
(http://www.lukasheise.com, axodoss@hotmail.com) so that sound can be 
used conveniently.  There may also be a couple of utilities that links
to FreeImage.
